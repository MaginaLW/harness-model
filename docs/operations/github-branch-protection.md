# GitHub branch protection checklist

Repository administrators must configure these settings in GitHub; the workflow cannot change its own protection rules.

- Require the `ai-quality-gate` check before merge.
- Require the pull-request branch to be current with its base branch.
- Disallow direct pushes and force pushes to protected branches.
- Limit bypass permission to named repository administrators or emergency roles.
- Require every bypass to carry a separate, retained audit record with actor, reason, affected commit, and follow-up verification.

The workflow uses only `contents: read`, receives no secrets, and runs on `pull_request`, not `pull_request_target`. It verifies and gates the PR head, uploads runner-temp evidence and redacted logs, and performs no merge, push, deployment, approval, or branch-protection mutation.
